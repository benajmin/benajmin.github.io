				<h1>I Accidentally Volunteered at a Robotics Competition</h1>
				<h6>March 2018</h6>
				<div class="pull-right"><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="FRC.jpg" alt="FRC Powerup field at Waterloo district event" height="378" width="400"></div> 
				
				<p>When the organiser of UWRi3D asked me to help setup for the First Robotics Competition, I was more than happy to help out. I thought I'd go for the morning, set up the field, maybe get some free food and leave in time for CS class. But boy was I wrong.</p>

				<p>The start of CS came and passed without me even noticing. I was enjoying myself so much I didn't want to leave. Once the field was setup and teams started to arrive I stayed around, hoping there was more I could help with. I was told to hang out at pit admin, in case I was needed for anything else. While I was at pit admin there was an announcement that needed to be made, and since no one else wanted to do it, I volunteered.</p>

				<p>Before I knew it I was a volunteer for the whole weekend. The volunteer coordinator like my announcer voice, and suddenly I had a name tag, a t-shirt and later on even a walkie talkie. I announced upcoming matches all weekend, and I had an amazing time doing it.</p>

				<p>I'd never been to an FRC event before. My highschool only started a team after I left, so it was all a new and exciting experience. It was amazing to see the teams working together, to see the massive robots they had built in just six weeks. </p>

				<p>But even more amazing was how the teams helped each other. I remember announcing a part request for a team, and within minutes seeing at least 5 different teams running over to help. FIRST's focus on gracious proffessionalism has created an amazing environment of teamwork and cooperation. An environment that I'm proud to now be a part of.</p>
